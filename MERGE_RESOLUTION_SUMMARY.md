# Merge Resolution Summary for PR #10

## Overview
Successfully resolved merge conflicts between PR #10 (`copilot/update-server-and-package-files`) and the main branch. The resolution preserves both the existing React/Vite application infrastructure and adds the new minimal Node.js Express server functionality.

## Conflicting Files Resolved

### 1. `package.json`
**Strategy**: Merged both dependency sets
- Kept React/Vite dependencies from main branch
- Added Express server dependencies from PR #10
- Combined scripts to support both development modes
- **Key Scripts**:
  - `npm run dev` - Start Vite development server (React app)
  - `npm run dev:server` - Start Express server (minimal Node.js server)
  - `npm run test:server` - Run server-specific tests

### 2. `server.cjs` (previously `server.js`)
**Strategy**: Used PR #10's version
- Kept the simple Express server with error handling from PR #10
- Renamed from `.js` to `.cjs` for CommonJS compatibility (package.json has `"type": "module"`)
- Features include:
  - Static file serving
  - Health check endpoint (`/health`)
  - 404 error handling
  - 500 error handling
  - Graceful shutdown on SIGTERM/SIGINT

### 3. `server.test.cjs` (previously `server.test.js`)
**Strategy**: Added from PR #10
- Comprehensive test suite with 9 tests
- Tests health endpoint, static file serving, error handling
- All tests passing ✅

### 4. `.gitignore`
**Strategy**: Combined both versions
- Merged entries from both branches
- Includes coverage files, dist, node_modules, environment files, etc.

### 5. `jest.config.cjs` (previously `jest.config.js`)
**Strategy**: Merged both configurations
- Supports both TypeScript and JavaScript/CommonJS tests
- Renamed to `.cjs` for CommonJS compatibility
- Includes coverage for both `src/` and `server.cjs`

### 6. `tsconfig.json`
**Strategy**: Kept main branch version
- Preserves React/Vite TypeScript configuration
- Supports the existing application architecture

### 7. `index.html`
**Strategy**: Kept main branch version
- Preserves React application entry point
- Works with Vite development server

### 8. `README.md`
**Strategy**: Used PR #10's version with additions
- Added Repository Inheritance link back to navigation
- Includes comprehensive Quick Start instructions for both development modes
- Documents environment variable setup
- Includes testing instructions

### 9. `INTEGRATION.md`
**Strategy**: Kept main branch's Repository Inheritance section
- Preserved comprehensive documentation about the inheritance system

### 10. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
**Strategy**: Kept main branch version
- Preserves comprehensive GitHub Actions deployment workflow
- Includes proper SSH deployment, testing, and notification steps

### 11. `package-lock.json`
**Strategy**: Regenerated
- Removed conflicted version and regenerated based on merged `package.json`
- All dependencies installed successfully

## ES Module Compatibility Fix

Since `package.json` contains `"type": "module"`, CommonJS files were renamed:
- `jest.config.js` → `jest.config.cjs`
- `server.js` → `server.cjs`
- `server.test.js` → `server.test.cjs`

This ensures proper module resolution in a hybrid ES Module/CommonJS environment.

## Testing Results

✅ All server tests passing (9/9 tests)
✅ Server runs successfully on port 3000
✅ Health endpoint returns proper JSON
✅ Static files served correctly
✅ 404 errors handled gracefully
✅ Dependencies installed without errors

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Run server tests
npm run test:server

# Start Express server
npm run dev:server

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Start React/Vite development server
npm run dev
```

## Files Modified
- `.eslintrc.js` (new)
- `.gitignore` (merged)
- `README.md` (merged)
- `INTEGRATION.md` (merged)
- `index.html` (kept main)
- `jest.config.cjs` (merged, renamed)
- `package.json` (merged)
- `package-lock.json` (regenerated)
- `server.cjs` (from PR, renamed)
- `server.test.cjs` (new, renamed)
- `tsconfig.json` (kept main)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (kept main)

## Outcome

The merge successfully combines:
1. **React/Vite Application** - Existing functionality preserved
2. **Express Server** - New minimal Node.js development environment added
3. **Comprehensive Testing** - Server tests added with full coverage
4. **Dual Development Modes** - Support for both Vite and Express server development

The repository now supports two development modes that can coexist:
- **Frontend Development**: Use `npm run dev` for the React application
- **Server Development**: Use `npm run dev:server` for the Express server

This provides maximum flexibility for different development scenarios while maintaining backward compatibility with the existing codebase.
